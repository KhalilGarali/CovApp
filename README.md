# CoVapp -  COVID-19 Health Companion for the Elderly

## Introduction

CoVapp is a high-level prototype developed as part of a student project aimed at exploring the UI/UX design process. The project provided us with an opportunity to delve into various aspects of design, including research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing.

## Purpose

The primary objective of CoVapp was to gain practical experience in designing a mobile application focused on providing COVID-19 information and assistance. Through this project, we aimed to understand the importance of user-centered design principles and how they influence the overall user experience.

## Project Components

- **Research**: Conducted surveys and gathered insights to understand user needs and preferences.
- **Design**: Created sketches, wireframes, and user personas to visualize the app's structure and functionality.
- **Prototyping**: Developed a dynamic prototype using Figma to simulate user interactions and flow.
- **User Testing**: Gathered feedback from peers and potential users to iterate and improve the prototype.

## Learnings

- **UI/UX Design Process**: Explored the iterative nature of design and the importance of user feedback.
- **Collaboration**: Worked as a team to brainstorm ideas, share insights, and refine the prototype.
- **Problem-solving**: Addressed design challenges and made decisions to enhance usability and accessibility.
